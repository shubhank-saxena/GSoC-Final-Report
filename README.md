## Abstract
My proposal was selected for `MediaCMS - modern, fully featured video and media CMS`under `GFOSS Open Technologies Alliance`. <br/>
`MediaCMS` is a modern, fully featured open-source video and media CMS. It is developed to meet the needs of modern web platforms for viewing and sharing media. It can be used to build a small to medium video and media portal within minutes.<br/>
It is built mostly using the modern stack `Django + React, Celery` and includes a `REST API`. `MediaCMS` is a very useful project empowering communities around the globe to host their own media and content management system. It also helps educational institutes to manage their media and course curriculum by supporting various media formats like Video, Audio, PDF. Docs, etc.

## Goal
